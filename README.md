An MVP for a cricket fantasy app, made to understand how fantasy cricket apps could have been made, scaled, and used. This app is made using Flutter, and the backend is in TypeScript + Node.js, Express with Redis for caching, and RabbitMQ for offloading async tasks. The database used for this app is Postgres, and the ORM is Sequelize.

Just a try effort, adding more features and improving it :)
